    <h1>Learn How Colors work in CSS!</h1>
    <h2>Ever wonder how colors work in CSS?</h2>
    <p>
      When you first start doing web development, sometimes there are things are
      totally perplexing, yet have nothing to do with programming.
    </p>
    <p>
      For me, one of those things was colors. How do we change the colors of
      conent and fonts on a website? What is the difference between RGB, HSL,
      and hexidecimal? What does these even mean, and why do these different
      systems exist in the first place?
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal of this website is to give you a good understanding of how colors
      work. I think many of us start messing around with colors using the "guess
      and check" method, only having a vague understanding of how they actually
      work. I hope this website will help you an intuitive understanding of how
      colors work and how to use them to make your websites look great, without
      having to do countless rounds of guess and check.
